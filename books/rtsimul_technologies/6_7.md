## 6.7. CONCLUSION

The LET allows the explicit specification of timing behavior independent of a specific platform, that is, LET abstracts from the physical execution time and thus from the execution platform and the communication topology. Thus, LET-based systems exhibit behavior equivalent or close to the platform without the necessity to specify platform details. Another significant advantage compared to the state-of-the-art is that the resulting embedded real-time systems generated from a LET-based language such as TDL are deterministic, composable, and portable. In this chapter, we presented the core concepts of TDL and its integration in two quite different modeling and simulation environments: MATLAB and Simulink and Ptolemy II. In both the cases, the integration concept and its implementation ensure that the simulation of time-triggered tasks exhibits the same behavior as the execution of the generated code on any potentially distributed hardware platform.
