**20.1**            **FUTURE** **DEVELOPMENTS**

RT and HIL methods will certainly benefit from parallel computing, especially through the introduction of multicore processors. Particularly in the field of combustion engines, parallelization may pave the way toward RT simulation of one- dimensional gas dynamics, multizone cylinder models, and even CFD models that are beyond the current capabilities of standard RT hardware.

This will go well with the drastically increasing complexity of combustion engines due to emission relevant components such as selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalytic converters or low pressure EGR, the usage of biofuels, and the demand for further improvement of fuel economy. The new era of electric and hybrid vehicles challenges the field of combustion engine control through a multitude of innovative topologies and use cases unknown to traditional automotive design. Simulation and particularly RT techniques will be able to close the gap in knowledge and experience while investigating the complex interactions between electronic, computational, and mechanical subsystems that will emerge from the integrated development of reliable and economical automotive systems.
