## 21.6 CONCLUSIONS

This chapter provides an introduction to AUTOSAR as a language for system-level modeling and SWC modeling. Focus is on the issues related to the use of AUTOSAR models for simulation purposes and on the integration of AUTOSAR models with heterogeneous models (such as Simulink) for behavioral modeling. Also, the new timing model of AUTOSAR is analyzed with respect to its capability of defining a discrete-time base for simulation purposes or, in general, a timing model that allows seamless migration or integration of SR models. In conclusion, AUTOSAR is a promising solution for filling some of the gaps of modern methodologies with respect to platform modeling and system-level modeling and analysis, but still lacks the support of a formal (based on mathematical rules) MoC and of timed events.
