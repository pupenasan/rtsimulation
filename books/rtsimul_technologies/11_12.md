## 11.12. CONCLUSION

This chapter has introduced a novel compositional modeling framework for system-level performance estimation of heterogeneous embedded systems. The framework is simulation-based and allows performance estimation to be carried out throughout all design phases ranging from early functional to cycle accurate models. Using a separation of the specification of functionality, communication, cost, and implementation, combined with an interface-based approach, provides a very flexible framework with great refinement possibilities. Also, the framework enables the possibility for components, described at different levels of abstraction, to coexist and communicate within the same model instance.
