## **DEFINITIONS**

•   *DETER*–Cyber Defense Technology Experimental Research: A computer network, used for network security experiments, at the University of Utah, which contains physical compute nodes and a highly configurable network topology.

•   *DNP3.0*–A protocol used to gather data and issue control commands between master and slave devices. Also goes by DNP v3.0, DNP3, or just DNP.

•   *Power Grid*–The collection of buses, generators, lines, transformers, and so on that comprises the system of power delivery from power stations to power consumers.

•   *Substation*–Also known as an outstation, the substation is an unmanned location in charge of controlling and collecting data from intelligent elec- tronic devices (IEDs) in the immediate area.

•   *Data Aggregator*–A SCADA device at the substation level, which exists to compile data from the RTUs and report the data to the control station.

•   *RINSE*–Real-Time Immersive Network Simulation Environment.

•   *Modbus*–A legacy protocol that operates point-to-point, generally over a serial connection such as RS-232.

•   *RTU*–Remote terminal units are devices in the substation that are respon- sible for responding to requests from the control station.

•   *SCADA*–Supervisory control and data acquisition: A generic term for industrial control systems.

•   *Control Station*–Central locations used to coordinate control decisions for regions of the power grid.

•   *TCP/IP*–The Transmission Control Protocol and the Internet Protocol: Commonly used protocol combination in the Internet to address packets to processes and route segments to hosts.

•   *CRC*–Cyclic redundancy check: The CRC is used to detect bit errors that occur during communication.

•   *Relay*–A digital device that measures circuit status and can open/close a physical breaker.

•   *PowerWorld*–A steady-state power simulator.
