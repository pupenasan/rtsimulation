## 16.6. CONCLUSIONS

This chapter has investigated the problem of real-time simulation for the online per- formance optimization of the policies or parameters of a DES. Given an observed sample path of a DES, the chapter has addressed the general sample path construc- tability problem and presented three concurrent simulation algorithms for solving the problem. The SC and the ASA approaches solve the problem very efficiently for a class of systems (although SC is more appropriate for offline simulation) with event lifetime distributions that satisfy the memoryless property. For more general systems, the TWA can be used to construct the sample paths of arbitrary DES using a sample path coupling approach. The TWA can be used in two modes, offline and online. In an offline setting, the objective of the TWA is to achieve a speedup factor greater than 1. On the contrary, in an online setting, the approach can be used for real-time control and optimization of DES. In this setting, the proposed concur- rent simulation approach provides significant benefits since in general it does not require prior knowledge of the various event lifetime distributions. Furthermore, the approach inherently uses the *CRN* scheme that has been observed experimentally and was proved theoretically in some cases to be effective in variance reduction.17
