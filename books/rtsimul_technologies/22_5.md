**22.1**            **CONCLUSIONS**

Multidomain physical system modeling with Modelica has proven to be a key technology for model-based systems development. This chapter provides an overview of the Modelica language and the key features that make it a desirable modeling platform to support real-time simulation. Several different sample models are provided to provide concrete examples of the features discussed. Selected simulation results highlight the computational impact of model formulation and symbolic manipulation. Published work is reviewed to convey a sense for the variety of real-world applications from many different domains that are supported by real-time simulation with Modelica.

With continued development by the Modelica Association, enhancements to the language and standard library are ongoing. The Modelica user base continues to grow as do the tools that support the Modelica language. This growth will continue to bring cutting edge modeling and simulation technology to the forefront to support both current and future real-time model-based system development applications.
