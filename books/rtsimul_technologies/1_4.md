## 1.4. HYBRID MODELS

In simple terms, a hybrid model is one that contains characteristics of both discrete and continuous models. There is extensive literature on the theory and analysis of hybrid systems (e.g., Ref. [17]).

For the purposes of developing simulations, a hybrid system can be viewed in some cases as a basically discrete model containing one or more states that change in a continuous fashion between events, and in others as a basically continuous model in which the states change continuously for most of the time but in which one or more of the states or their derivatives can occasionally change instantaneously. In yet other cases, the discrete and continuous processes may be balanced in an integrated model that is equally distributed between discrete and continuous components.

This distinction is important. Many currently available simulation software products provide comprehensive support for either discrete or continuous models with limited additional features that support the alternate approach. The balance between discrete and continuous elements in the model will, therefore, often dictate the choice of software to perform the simulation.

### 1.4.1 Time Management for Hybrid Simulations

Regardless of the balance between discrete and continuous elements in a model, time management for hybrid simulations requires synchronization between the processing of events and the continuous advance of time for the continuous elements. In some cases, a period of continuous simulation, which may be of limited duration, can be triggered by a discrete event. In this case, time-management control will switch from the discrete to continuous modes with the duration of time steps determined by the integration algorithm. The simulation will remain in continuous mode until either the continuous simulation terminates (generating another event) or an event occurs in the discrete part of the model that impacts the continuous part. It can cause the continuous simulation to terminate, or it can cause a change of input or even a change to the continuous mathematical model in some way. Conversely, changes in the state of the continuous system can generate new discrete events, for example, when a continuous variable exceeds some critical value, such as a temperature or pressure limit.

When discrete events are occurring during a period in which a continuous process is active, it is important to manage the time advance of the continuous process so that the end of a step coincides with the time of an event. In this regard, it is helpful to use a distinction, first introduced by Cellier [18], between *time events* and *state events*.

A timed event is one for which the event time is known in advance. An example would be a clock signal in a sampled-data system. The numerical integration step size should, where possible, be controlled so as to coincide with the known timing of timed events.

A state event is one that is triggered by a condition that depends on the values of state or other dynamic variables in the simulation, such as a temperature that rises above a set point. The nature of state events is such that their event times are not normally known in advance, and special procedures are required to process them.

In non-real-time applications, synchronization with both types of event is often achieved by using a variable-step integration algorithm and additional synchronization procedures between the discrete and continuous simulations. In real-time applications, it may be necessary to reduce the step size of a fixed-step integration algorithm to minimize timing errors. In the case of state events, the discrete event is triggered by the continuous simulation, and it is again necessary either to use a variable-step algorithm to ensure accurate timing of the event or, particularly for real-time applications, to adopt a sufficiently short step size.

### 1.4.2 Software for Hybrid Simulations

Several software packages that were originally developed specifically for either discrete or continuous simulation have subsequently added features that support hybrid simulations.

Early work on developing numerical integration routines to handle discontinuities was carried out by Hay, Crosbie, and Chaplin [19,20]. They adapted a conventional fourth/fifth-order variable-step routine by adding an interpolation stage that is activated whenever an end-of-step check shows that a state event occurred during the step. They used a succession of interpolations, starting with a linear interpolation between the start and end of the step to produce a first approximation to the event time. This is followed by a quadratic interpolation using values at the start, approximate event time, and end of step to produce a more accurate value for the event time. Further iterations with thirdand higher-order interpolations are possible but not normally necessary to locate the event time with acceptable accuracy. This approach is very effective in non-real-time simulation and has been widely adopted, but it is not suitable for real-time simulation because of the variable and extended computation time whenever a state event occurs within a step.

This technique was later included in ESL, one of the first continuous simulation languages to introduce methods for processing discontinuities accurately and automatically. ESL was developed for the European Space Agency by Hay, Crosbie, and Pearce [21]. The way in which the discontinuities (events) are specified by the user is elegant and is based on the use of logical statements and a program construct known as a *when clause*. A when clause is a section of code that is executed when and only when (i.e., once only) a specified condition becomes true. More conventional conditional *if* statements can also be used to switch between different descriptions of a subsystem. Almost any discontinuous element can be described using *if* and *when* constructs.

A simple example of the use of the *when* clause is the code for a submodel for a T flip-flop. This device is assumed to toggle its single logical output whenever a trigger is applied to its input, which can be specified in ESL as

```pascal
SUBMODEL TFLOP(LOGICAL:flag:=LOGICAL:trigger);
    INITIAL
    flag:=false;
    DYNAMIC
    when trigger then
    flag:=not flag;
    end_when;
END TFLOP;
```

The first line defines a submodel named TFLOP that has a single logical output named *flag* and a single logical input named *trigger*. The *flag* is set to *false* in the INITIAL region. In the DYNAMIC region, which is executed at each time step, the *flag* is inverted when and only when the logical variable *trigger* changes from *false* to *true*. More statements could be inserted between *when* and *end_when*, and all of them would be executed whenever the *trigger* becomes *true*.

A more complex example, using both *if* and *when*, is illustrated by the following code template, which implements a method of defining a system that switches between three different states. A line preceded by a double hyphen (--) is a comment line.

```pascal
INITIAL
-- Initialize state state := 1;
DYNAMIC
when state=1 AND transition12 then state := 2;
when state=1 AND transition13 then state := 3;
when state=2 AND transition21 then state := 1;
when state=2 AND transition23 then state := 3;
when state=3 AND transition31 then state := 1;
when state=3 AND transition32 then state := 2;
end_when
-- Assign variables depending on state v1 :=if state=1 then <expression11>
else_if state=2 then <expression12> else_if state=3 then <expression13>;
--Repeat for all variables
```

 It is assumed that the simulation is initialized with the system in State 1. There may be additional initialization code in the INITIAL region. The DYNAMIC region uses *when* clauses to define the six possible transitions between the three states by means of the logical variables *transition12*, etc, which are normally all *false*. A state transition is indicated by setting the corresponding transition variable to *true*. The values of variables in a particular state are set using conditional *if* statements. Note that these are structured as assignments (:=) with conditional right-hand sides.

One of the strengths of ESL is that once a discontinuity has been defined in the code using *if* or *when* constructs (or by selecting a graphical element that is itself defined using such statements), it is automatically recognized and implicitly detected when the software runs with appropriate control of the step size. When models containing such discontinuities are simulated using a variable-step integration routine, and when the value of one of the *transition* variables changes from *false* to *true*, a discontinuity detection mechanism is invoked that adjusts step sizes in a way that ensures that the event time coincides with the end of an integration step, within a user-specified tolerance. This approach is not ideal for real-time simulation unless it can be guaranteed that the process will always reach a satisfactory conclusion within the available frame time. ESL does, however, support real-time simulation of these hybrid systems. The object-oriented modeling language Modelica [22] and the MathWorks product Simscape™ [23] also use the notion of *if* and *when* statements and corresponding semantics. Other languages, including ACSL and Simulink, have provided alternate ways of defining state events based on the definition of crossing detectors. Additional coding is usually necessary to link the specification of the event to its processing during execution.

Turning now to models that are basically discrete, some older discrete languages have added features for handling continuous elements. Simscript, for instance, features a continuous process that is illustrated by an example in the next section.

As stated earlier, when it was first developed in 1976, the DEVS formalism and the software products that implemented it were focused on discrete models. In the 1990s, continuous features were developed. We have already established that a numerical solution of differential equations is, in effect, a discrete process and is therefore accessible to representation using the DEVS formalism. It is necessary to capture the difference equations that arise from the continuous mathematical model combined with the selected numerical integration algorithm with DEVS. With a feature of this kind, a DEVS implementation is clearly capable of handling hybrid models. One example is PowerDEVS [24], a version of DEVS aimed specifically at powerelectronic circuits and systems, but capable of supporting a range of hybrid simulations including real-time simulations. PowerDEVS is also interesting in that it uses a QSS (Quantized State System) [6,25] approach to continuous simulation. QSS deals with systems in which system states, as well as time, change in finite increments. Simulations using QSS thus involve discretization of both time and state variables.

### 1.4.3 Examples of Hybrid Simulations

Understanding hybrid simulation techniques can be made easier by initially separating them into three groups: those that are basically continuous with discrete elements, those that are basically discrete with continuous elements, and those that are equally balanced. These distinctions can best be illustrated by simple examples.

#### 1.4.3.1 Continuous Model with a Discrete Element

One of the most commonly quoted examples of a hybrid system in the literature is the bouncing ball. A bouncing ball simulation provides an example of a continuous model (dynamics of the motion of the ball) with discrete elements (impact with a hard surface). In its simplest form, the continuous model equates the acceleration of the ball to acceleration due to gravity (d2*x/*d*t*2 *=* −*g* for *x >* 0) and assumes a hard impact in which the velocity of the ball changes instantaneously (d*x/*d*t**+ =* −*k**d*x/*d*t*), where the coefficient of restitution *k* is a dissipation factor.

Another simple example, which will be developed later, is provided by the electrical circuit in [Figure 1.2](#_bookmark1). An alternating current supply feeds a load consisting of a resistor and capacitor in parallel through a series resistance and a diode. The diode is represented by a very simple model of an ideal switch. If the voltage across it is positive, its resistance is assumed to be zero and the diode can be represented by a short circuit. If the voltage is negative, the resistance is infinite and the diode is represented by an open circuit. The voltage produced by the supply is *v* = *V*cos(*wt*). Assuming the capacitor is initially discharged, the initial value of *v* is equal to *V* and the diode will conduct. A simple mathematical model can be produced that recognizes two modes of operation of the circuit, the conducting mode and the nonconducting mode.

##### 1.4.3.1.1 Conducting Mode

Assuming ideal components, the key differential equation is provided by the relationship between voltage and current for the capacitor, which can be expressed as

**FIGURE 1.2** Example of a hybrid model: An electric circuit containing a switch

The sequence of calculation is as follows:

The value of the state *v*c is known at the beginning of a time step, either as an initial condition or the result of the calculation from the previous step. Given the value of *v*c at the current time *t*, it is possible to calculate the values of *i*R, *i*, and *i*c also at time *t* (in addition to *v*, which is defined for all time in the model). Given *i*c, it is then possible to calculate the current value of the derivative d*v*c/d*t*. This completes the computation of the state of the system at the given time instant. This is the point at which the algorithm chosen by the user to solve the differential equation takes over. Time is advanced by one time step, and the value of *v*c at time *t* + *h*, where *h* is the time increment, is calculated using the integration algorithm. A simple example would be to use Euler integration, which simply assumes that the value of d*v*c/d*t* at *t* is maintained constant over the next time increment so that the new value of *v*c is calculated as

![image-20220817225431247](media/image-20220817225431247.png)

The process is then repeated starting at *t* = *t* + *h* with the corresponding value of *v*c and is continued until the system mode changes to nonconducting or the terminating condition for the simulation is reached.

##### 1.4.3.1.2 Nonconducting Mode

   In the nonconducting mode, the RC load is disconnected from the supply. The governing equations are now

![image-20220817225451498](media/image-20220817225451498.png)

where

![image-20220817225504078](media/image-20220817225504078.png)

Given *v*c at the beginning of a time step, *i*R and *i*c can be calculated followed by d*v*c/d*t*. The numerical integration algorithm can then be used to calculate *v*c at the end of the next step.

A key question now is how to make the decision to switch between modes. As was discussed earlier, the answer to this question can be quite different for real-time and non-real-time simulations. When real-time execution is not required, a variable-step algorithm, preferably one that is combined with a discontinuity detection scheme, could be most appropriate. For real time, it may be necessary to use a fixed-step method, in which case the length of the step is constrained by the need to limit timing errors. This question is discussed further in Section 1.5.1.

#### 1.4.3.2 Example of a Discrete-Based Hybrid Simulation

Discrete models are widely used to represent industrial processes. Many of these models deal with the progress of materials or components as they move through a manufacturing process. Objects are held in queues waiting for equipment to become available to perform the next stage in the manufacturing process. Service times are often generated randomly using an appropriate distribution. In some cases, it is necessary to represent the process more accurately, and this may involve the use of a continuous model of a particular part of the total manufacturing process. Fayek [26] describes an application involving the movement of metal ingots into and out of a furnace.

A steel plant has a soaking pit furnace which is being used to heat up steel ingots. The interarrival time of the ingots is determined to be exponentially distributed with a mean of 1.5 hours. If there is an available soaking pit when an ingot arrives, it is immediately put into the furnace. Otherwise it is put into a warming pit where it is assumed to retain its initial temperature until a soaking pit is available.

Fayek describes both totally discrete and combined continuous–discrete (or hybrid) models to address this problem. In the discrete version, the time to heat an ingot in the furnace is uniformly distributed between 4 and 8 hours. In the hybrid version, it is determined by solving a differential equation representing the change in temperature of the ingot:

![image-20220817225535465](media/image-20220817225535465.png)

where *hi* is the 1000°F temperature of the *i*th ingot, *H* is the furnace temperature (assumed to be 1500°F), and *ci* is the heating time coefficient of the *i*th ingot, which is equal to (0.07 + *x*), where *x* is normally distributed with a mean of 0.05 and a standard deviation of 0.01.

Ingots are to be heated to a final temperature that is normally distributed between 800 and 1000°F.

In a further variation of the simulation, the furnace temperature is assumed variable. It is normally heating up toward a given final temperature and is also reduced when cold ingots are put into the furnace. This adds a second differential equation for the furnace temperature as follows:

![image-20220817225554195](media/image-20220817225554195.png)

Introducing a cold ingot is assumed to produce an instantaneous fall in the furnace temperature depending on the difference between the furnace and ingot temperatures divided by the number of ingots in the furnace. This hybrid simulation was implemented in a version of Simscript V that supports continuous features. The simulation ran successfully, and the ability to model the dynamics of the heating and cooling effects provided a more valid representation of the entire process.

#### 1.4.3.3 Balanced Hybrid Simulation

Many of the documented applications involving hybrid simulations are of the above kinds, either mainly discrete or mainly continuous. An example of a more balanced hybrid simulation is provided by a study performed for the European Space Agency by the author and colleagues using ESL [27]. It involves an artificially created simulation that was intended to demonstrate the ability of ESL to perform simulations that combined a balance of continuous and queuing elements. This is not generally a straightforward task with most simulation software systems. It contains continuous and both types of discrete elements discussed earlier (queues and sampled data). The continuous model (derived from an ACSL example) is illustrated in Figure 1.3.

It contains a subsystem with a transfer function 1/*s*(*s* + 1). The output, *X*, of this system is compared to a set point *X*c to form an error signal *E*. A sampled version of *E* is passed to a digital controller, which generates a control signal *U*. The control is a linear combination of the current error, *E*(*n*), the previous error, *E*(*n* − 1), and the previous control, *U*(*n* − 1). The difference equation describing the controller is

![image-20220817225618831](media/image-20220817225618831.png) 

The constants *A*0, *A*1, and *B*1 depend upon the equivalent lead and lag time constants of the controller (*T*lead and *T*lag) and the sampling period *T*s. A delay is added to the updating of *U* to represent the computation delay in the digital controller.

This basic example was extended (see [Figure 1.4](#_bookmark2)) by making the assumption that the actual set point, unknown to the controller, is drifting (represented by an

![image-20220817225636250](media/image-20220817225636250.png)

**FIGURE 1.3** Continuous part of combined continuous–discrete benchmark.

additional sinusoidal variation). It is assumed that a mechanism exists for indicating when the true error from the actual set point exceeds a given threshold by generating a logical alarm signal. This alarm message is transmitted over a communication link to an operator console where it is queued with other messages until the operator is available to take corrective action. A correction message is then sent back to the system, which has the effect of resetting the set point. The system also has the ability to determine when the alarm condition clears spontaneously, in which case it sends a cancellation message, which will cancel the original alarm if it is received before the alarm has been acted upon. This system incorporates the following features of combined continuous/discrete systems:

•   State events generated from within a continuous subsystem

•   Synchronous A/D sampling of continuous variables

•   Updating of continuous variables through a D/A converter

•   Components described by difference equations/z-transforms

•   Digital computation delays

•   Queuing of events awaiting processing

•   Cancellation of queued events

•   A server (operator) responding to queued events in sequence 

The entire simulation was coded in ESL using ESL primitives. ESL is a traditional CSSL with discrete features. It is to be expected that more recent hybrid simulation software products that are aimed specifically at hybrid systems would facilitate the development of simulations of this kind.

One of the outcomes of this study was a list of recommended enhancements to the ESL language to make it more capable of supporting balanced hybrid models with features similar to those in the benchmark. These included

•   Add support for discrete variable types and a notation for difference equations

•   Support the use of z-transforms

•   Improve processing of time events

•   Introduce an EVENT block for defining state and time events

•   Support queues so that they can be easily specified and manipulated by the user

•   Provide a greater range of random number distributions

•   Provide support for user-specified statistical outputs

•   Provide support for producing results in the form of event lists

These changes were aimed at producing a more balanced hybrid simulation capability. Most of them remain unimplemented.
