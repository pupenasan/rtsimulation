## 2.5. SUMMARY

In this chapter, we demonstrated that DEVS and RT-DEVS can serve as an efficient system design framework for many of today’s complex real-time distributed systems. Compared to other formalized approaches, DEVS shows many advantages with its unique features, which include fast hierarchical model construction/reconstruction, model reusability, and ease of model validation. Furthermore, the flexible M&S tools and environments that DEVS enables can help in discovering optimal system design quickly as well as in validating existing designs.

Furthermore, we also expect that distributed DEVS can aid the design of distributed real-time systems in a more accurate and effective method. This is because distributed DEVS models can better represent physical systems. Thus, simulating distributed DEVS design models can provide a more accurate picture to identify the design defects and capture the key design parameters that must be effectively manipulated.
