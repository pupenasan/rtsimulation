## 2.3. DEVS AS A MODEL-BASED DESIGN FORMALIZATION TOOL

As we have introduced, DEVS separates system models from their simulators, thus it natively supports a formal and model-based system design approach. In this section, we will discuss some background of DEVS as an effective model-based system design tool. To set the stage for the discussion of DEVS, we review model-based system design.

### 2.3.1 Model-Based System Design

With the rapid advance of today’s computer systems, a formalized system design pro- cess has been assuming an increasingly important role, in particular, for the design of distributed real-time computer systems. Traditionally, the design of such systems is independent from their implementation, test, and design validation. Thus, the overall design practice is time-consuming and error-prone. Model-based design is one of the modern approaches for complex system design. It is based on design models that attempt to capture the key system design parameters, and generally it requires the use of formal system specification languages, such as timed automata and DEVS. For instance, Schulz and Rozenblit [1] proposed a novel system codesign method using a formal specification language, such as DEVS, for aiding the design of embedded systems. Hu and Zeigler

[2] proposed a model-based design framework for dynamic distributed real-time sys- tems that introduces the concept of “model continuity,” which it leverages extensively. Indeed, embedded systems and distributed real-time systems are not the only areas in which a model-based formal design approach have been applied. The design of today’s VEs is also affected by the concept of a model-based approach, and the feasibility and effectiveness of using a model-based approach for designing VE systems have been investigated. For example, VR-WISE (a Virtual Reality modeling framework) has been employed as a tool for behavior specification and development [3]. It is actually a model- based design method, which makes the design of VEs more intuitive. One of the key advantages of VR-WISE is that it requires less virtual reality background and can be used by a broader audience [3]. Similarly, a simulation-based design methodology using composable models has been presented [4] that uses a tightly integrated design environ- ment for the development of both the form and behavior of the system components.

Indeed, a model-based design approach opens a new direction toward solving complex distributed real-time computer systems. The application areas have been expanded to VEs, real-time P2P networks, and QoS-aware distributed systems, just to name a few. Compared to traditional approaches, model-based design involves not only building accurate design models but also simulating the design model in predefined experimental frames (EFs), through which design defects can be easily captured in the early design phases. Moreover, the optimal system design can be easily discovered by simulating models of design alternatives. Meanwhile, model validation becomes easy because of the use of a formal specification language.

### 2.3.2 DE VS and RT-DE VS

DEVS [5] is a mathematical formalism originally developed for specifying discrete event systems. DEVS is a well-known theoretical approach to M&S and has attracted many researchers for reliable and efficient system M&S. The key idea of DEVS is to use “atomic” models to express individual component’s behavior and to use “coupled” models to represent the interactions between the components in a system. The DEVS modeling framework fundamentally supports the reusability of indi- vidual models and also provides an efficient methodology for hierarchical model construction, which in turn can provide maximum flexibility for system M&S. As a pioneering formal M&S methodology, DEVS provides a concrete simulation theo- retical foundation, which promotes fully object-oriented M&S techniques for solv- ing today’s complex M&S problems.

As such, the standard and basic DEVS formalism consists of two formalisms, one for atomic models (AMs) and one for coupled models. The atomic DEVS is expressed as follows:

 ![image-20220819000059805](media/image-20220819000059805.png)

where

![image-20220819000116523](media/image-20220819000116523.png)

As a matter of fact, the AM is a building block for a more complex coupled model, which defines a new model constructed by connecting basic model components. Two major activities involved in defining a coupled model are specifying its component models and defining the couplings that create the desired communication networks. Therefore, a DEVS-coupled model is defined as follows:

The DEVS M&S framework is very different from traditional module and func- tion-based ones. It provides a very flexible and scalable M&S foundation by separat- ing models and simulators. Figure 2.1 shows how DEVS model components interact with DEVS and non-DEVS simulators through the DEVS simulation protocol. We can also see that DEVS models interact with each other through DEVS simulators. The separation of models from simulators is a key aspect in DEVS, which is criti- cal for scalable simulation and middleware-supported distributed simulation such as those using CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture), HLA (high- level architecture), and MPI (Message Passing Interface).

The advantages of such a framework are obvious because model development is in fact not affected by underlying computational resources for executing the model. Therefore, models maintain their reusability and can be stored or retrieved from a model repository. The same model system can be executed in different ways using different DEVS simulation protocols. In such a setting, commonly used middleware technologies for parallel and distributed computing could be easily applied on sepa- rately developed DEVS models. Therefore, within the DEVS framework, model com- ponents can be easily migrated from single processor to multiprocessor and vice versa.

If we have a closer look at the DEVS-based modeling framework, we find that it is based on a hierarchical model construction technique as shown in [Figure 2.2](#_bookmark3). For example, a coupled model is obtained by adding a coupling specification to a set of AMs. This coupled model can then be used as a component in a larger system with new components. A hierarchical coupled model can be constructed level by level by adding a set of model components (either atomic or coupled) as well as coupling information among these components. Consequently, a reusable model repository for developers is created. The DEVS-based modeling framework also supports a model component as a “black box,” where the internals of the model are hidden and only the behavior of it is exposed through its input/output ports.

One interesting aspect of DEVS formalism is that a coupled DEVS model can be expressed as an equivalent basic model (or AM) and so DEVS models adhere to closure under coupling. Such an equivalent basic model derived from a coupled model can then be employed in a larger coupled model. Therefore, DEVS formalism provides a robust composition framework that supports closure under coupling and hierarchical construction.

RT-DEVS extends the aforementioned basic DEVS for real-time M&S applica- tions. It differentiates from basic DEVS in that an activity set *A* and its associated mapping function ψ are added to the existing atomic DEVS to provide the real- time interaction capabilities for DEVS models in their environments. Thus, different model components in a real-time system can be encapsulated uniformly by this new formalism. Indeed, RT-DEVS formalism aims to solve the discrete event-based sys- tem problems because of the real-time requirement and is able to specify real-time distributed systems as DEVS models. The RT-DEVS formalism is defined by Hong and Kim [26], and an atomic RT-DEVS model can be expressed as follows: 

![image-20220819000332289](media/image-20220819000332289.png)

where

As a real-time extension of standard DEVS, RT-DEVS establishes the basis for using DEVS for system design when real-time concerns are key to a successful design. As a matter of fact, RT-DEVS has been adopted by many researchers as a fundamental method to investigate the hard-to-predict behavior of complex real-time distributed systems. Compared to other real-time formal specification languages, RT-DEVS extends all the advantages of standard DEVS, which makes the system design practices more efficient and reliable.

### 2.3.3 DE VS as a Form alized Aid to System Design

As discussed earlier, in recent years, many formal languages have been used to aid in system design, including UML [27], timed automata [28], Petri nets, [29] and statecharts [30]. However, to a large extent these formal languages have not been very suitable for the design of large-scale and complex systems because of the lack of effective model-driven engines (simulators), reusable model repositories, flexible model composition, etc.

DEVS [5] distinguished itself from these formalized system design approaches in that it can provide a more efficient system design modeling framework in which design alternatives can be easily constructed and simulated, as shown in [Figure 2.3](#_bookmark4). Indeed, DEVS model-based design has been used by many researchers for solving complex system design problems. The key differences between DEVS and other formal approaches is that DEVS supports reusable hierarchical model develop- ment, and the DEVS design model can be simulated in one unified framework to quickly discover system design problems. In other words, DEVS can make it much easier to identify design problems, validate system design, and discover optimal system design.
