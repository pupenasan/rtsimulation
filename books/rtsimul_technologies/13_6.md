## 13.6. CHALLENGES AND LESSONS LEARNED

To develop the interactive FCS and implement it to the flight simulation platform, a number of challenges were encountered and have been addressed in the research investigation.

•   The design, simulation, and integration architecture. The I/O interface is required to be consistent, such that the model can be substituted seamlessly.

•   The switch between the simulator built-in autopilot function and the designed one must be smooth. It is activated by a command to turn on the design (and automatically overwrites the default one). It is automatically turned off once the testing phase is complete.

•   Version control. Even though it is a relatively trivial issue, we did experience on a couple of occasions that the off-line design and simulation model was not compatible with the nonlinear platform for flight simulation. It was solved by specifying the version and release of the software environment.
