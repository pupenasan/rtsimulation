## 19.7. VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION OF THE CDTRP BASED ON BENCHMARK PLANTS

This subsection presents experimentation results realized for verification and validation of the operating modes of the CDTRP on three physical plants and the results obtained by the investigations on reliable operating frequency of mixed modes of the CDTRP are presented in this subsection.

In this section, the benchmark plants that are implemented as simulation, emulation, or physical hardware for verification of the operating modes of the CDTRP are listed. A set of benchmark plants that can be chosen by the users via the plant selection button in the front panel of the GUI are included in the menu of the CDTRP to help the users expediently analyze their control methods on these selected benchmark plants. This menu is open to be extended by the users to cover a larger class of benchmarks or any other plants of interest. The plants must be defined by at most three-dimensional state equations.*

The benchmark plants available in the menu are listed in [Table 19.4 ](#_bookmark105)and these are also used for verification of the operating modes of the developed CDTRP. The benchmark plants in Table 19.4 are chosen from benchmarks extensively used in the literature (which implies that they are difficult to identify and/or difficult to control) to compare the system identification methods and/or to compare the controller design methods or they are of practical importance in some other sense.

This section is devoted to demonstrating how to implement the controller design– test–redesign procedure introduced in the previous section to reach a controller working well for a physical plant operated under the actual environmental conditions. A micro DC motor is chosen as the plant and the final operating mode is determined as S-R-R, where the PC is used as the controller, the physical plant is the micro DC motor, the sensor, and actuator, that is, the encoder and driver are realized in a PIC microcontroller driver card (see [Figure 19.6](#_bookmark106)). In the initial design stage of the controller design–test–redesign procedure, the S-S-S mode was found to be the most suitable mode for one because of the simulation efficiency of the simple yet realistic DC motor models but also because of its implementation flexibility as observed in a set of experiments conducted in the S-S-S, S-E-S, and S-E-E modes.

In the test stage, the S-E-E mode was first implemented for testing the considered controller design methods on the emulated plant under emulated environmental conditions. Then, the controller candidates were analyzed in the S-E-R mode. It was found that the S-E-R mode is the most suitable mode for testing the considered control

methods, since it enables analysis of the controller candidates under quite realistic conditions, while still providing flexibility in simulating different controller candidates efficiently. In the redesign stage, the S-R-S and S-R-E modes were implemented at the beginning and then the S-R-R mode was implemented as the final mode where the parameters of the controller that were found to be the best in the test stage were tuned.

The details of the above explained steps of the implementation of the controller design–test–redesign procedure for the DC motor example are presented next.

**19.5.2.1**            **Implementation of the Physical Plant Together** **with** **Its** **Physical** **Actuator** **and** **Sensor** **Units**

A micro DC motor was considered. The DC motor driver card (see Figure 19.6) was realized with a PIC18F452 microcontroller driver unit that has a serial interface to communicate with the PC. The speed of the motor was considered as the output and was measured by an encoder to provide feedback to the system. The microcontrollerbased driver unit drives the DC motor speed revolutions per minute (rpm) via pulse width modulation (PWM) changing between 0% and 100%. That is to say, in the implemented S-R-S, S-R-E, and S-R-R operating modes, the control signal from CDTRP is converted into a PWM signal to control physical DC motor speed rpm.

 

**19.5.2.2**            **Identification of DC Motor to Obtain a Model** **to** **Be** **Simulated** **and** **Emulated**

To simulate and also emulate the physical DC motor in the simulated-plant and emulated-plant modes that are to be used for the design and test stages, a system

identification procedure was applied to the physical DC motor and then the simplest yet realistic model for the considered micro DC motor was obtained.*

A step function, which is obtained by changing PWM sharply, was fed to the physical DC motor plant. The input–output data pairs of the plant necessary for the identification were measured via the hyper-terminal of the PC. After the process of data gathering, the transfer function of the plant was found under the assumption of a single-input single-output linear dynamic system for the plant. It is known [44,51] that the physical DC motor plant can be well modeled as a first-order delayed dynamic system according to the response of the plant due to the step input. The step response of the first-order system defined with three parameters is provided in the Laplace and time domain, respectively, as follows:



*H*(*s*) =



*K*

  *Ts* + 1



e*Ls*



(19.1)



*h*(*t*) = *K* (1e-(*t*-*L* )/*T* ) @ *K* (1e-*t* /*T* )



(19.2)



where *T* is the time constant, *L* is the dead-time, and *K* is the gain [52]. If the dead-time *L* is sufficiently small compared to the time constant *T* of the plant, the step response of the system can be approximated as shown in Equation 19.2. Thus, a first-order micro DC motor model (BP5 in [Table 19.4](#_bookmark105)) was obtained with the measured maximum motor speed 4224 rpm, the time constant 0.5 s, and the dead-time 0.011 s. This model was used for the S-S-S, S-E-S, S-E-E, S-E-E, and S-E-R operating modes of the CDRTP. Although the first-order system is sufficient to model the physical micro DC motor for testing the candidate controllers, a second-order model is also identified and implemented for validating the emulator of the platform by analyzing the emulation performance of the platform with a more realistic model. The considered second- order delay dynamic system model is defined in the Laplace domain as follows:

\* It should be noted that although more complicated models better suited to the real data measured from the DC motor can be derived, it was preferred to work with this simple model for the plant. Not only does the simple model allow taking advantage of efficient simulation and emulation of the DC motor, but it also allows more focus on testing the controllers’ performances on the considered DC motor and on its simulated/emulated model in a comparative way, rather than on simulating/emulating the DC motor more realistically by more complicated models. In fact, it was observed that choosing a simple first-order dynamic model for the DC motor that was identified by using a step response method provides sufficiently close responses to the ones measured from the physical DC motor and also enables seeing the differences among the performances of the different controllers implemented.

where *K* is the gain, *L* is the dead-time, z is the damping ratio, and *wn* is the natural frequency. The damping ratio and natural frequency were determined from the *P*o overshoot percentage in Equation 19.4 and *T*s settling time in Equation 19.5 [52]. The second-order micro DC motor model was obtained based on the measured *P*o of 10%, *T*s of 4.46, and the dead-time of 0.011 s.

**19.5.2.3**            **Recreating the Disturbance and Parameter Perturbation Effects** The disturbance and parameter perturbation effects that can be implemented in the emulator by means of the signal generator and power supply components of the hard-

ware peripheral unit were produced in the implemented S-E-R and S-R-R modes to

recreate an actual environment. Since there is no such interface possibility of the simulators running on the PCs and emulators in the simulation/emulation platforms known in the literature, this is a unique feature of the developed CDTRP platform.

**19.5.2.4**            **Controller** **Design–Test–Redesign** **Process**

The DC motor speed tracking problem was chosen as a case study. The following four different types of controllers were designed using mainly the S-S-S, S-E-S, and S-E-E modes, then tested using the S-E-E and S-E-R modes on the identified model BP5, and finally using the S-R-S, S-R-E, and S-R-R modes on the realized micro DC motor: (1) a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller designed by the Ziegler–Nichols (ZN) method [13,14,52], (2) a PID controller designed by the Chien, Hrones, and Reswick (CHR) method [53], (3) a robust controller designed by the partitioned robust control (PRC) method [54], and (4) a direct adaptive controller designed by the Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) method [54].

A PID controller that defines the control signal *u* in terms of the error is given as follows:

*u* = *K*p*e* + *K*i ò *e* d *t* + *K*d*e*                 (19.6)

where *e* is the error between the desired and actual output of the plant, *e* is the derivative with respect to time of the error, and *K*p, *K*i, and *K*d are the proportional, integral, and derivative gain parameters, respectively. In the first method, the parameters of the PID controller were calculated based on the BP5 plant model as *K*p = 54.54, *K*i = 2479.3, and *K*d = 0.3 by using the ZN step response method. In the second method (CHR), which was preferred for yielding minimum overshooting [12], the PID controller parameters were calculated* as *K*p = 43.18, *K*i = 1635.6, and *K*d = 0.1995. The PRC is designed as having two separate parts: (1) proportional-derivative (PD) control *ue* and (2) auxiliary control *uy* [54,55]. In this method, given a plant model *x* = -*ax* + *bu* (e.g., BP5 model), the control signal was calculated as follows:



*u* = *u*e + *uy* = *K*v*e* + *K*p*e* *ax* D*ax*



(19.7)



where *Kv* and *K*p gains related to the control input *u*e were chosen greater than zero, and for the auxiliary controller *uy*D*a* = 1.2*a* was chosen for removing the parameter

​     

\* The considered PID controller is actually redesigned at this step within the terminology introduced in this chapter.

perturbations and plant uncertainties. In the fourth method applied, the MRAC

controller is composed of a first-order reference model *x* *m*, two adaptive controller parameters *u* *k*, *u* *k*, and a control signal *u* as follows:

*y*    *r*

*x* *m* = -*am xm* + *bmr*

*u* *y* = -l(*xm* *x* )*yam* (e*a**m* )



*u* = -l(*x* **-** *x* )*ra*



(e*a**m* )                      (19.8)



*r*           *m           m*

*u* = *ur* + *uy*

where *y* stands for the actual output, r stands for the reference signal, the designed parameter was chosen as l = 0.5, and the values of the reference model parameters *am* and *bm* are two times the values of the BP5 plant parameters. The equations in Equation 19.8 generate the control signal.

 

**19.5.2.5**            **The Simulation, Emulation, and Physical Measurement** **Results Obtained along the Entire Design Process** **Implemented** **by** **CDTRP**

The step responses of the physical DC motor and the BP5 implemented in the emulator (both controlled by the same controllers designed with the above-mentioned methods) for the desired output of 2500 rpm are given in Figure 19.7a through d,

respectively. It can be seen from the responses depicted in [Figure 19.7 ](#_bookmark107)that one may prefer the first two controllers, that is, the ones designed by the ZN and CHR methods, since the step responses of the emulator have relatively short rise times and are close to the reference signal, that is, the step function. However, the responses of the physical DC motor controlled by these two controllers for the same step input are not close to the emulated first-order model responses in the sense that the physical DC motor demonstrates second-order dynamic behavior rather than first-order.* On the contrary, the responses to the step input of the physical DC motor and the emulated first-order model are very close to each other for the MRAC case.

The following can then be concluded: (1) it can be expected that the real plant will behave similar to the emulator for the PRC and MRAC even if the plant model poorly reflects the behavior of the physical plant and (2) it can be expected that the physical plant will behave similar to the emulator for the PID controllers designed by the ZN and CHR methods only when the plant model is realistic so as to be capable of reflecting the behavior of the real plant well. So, the analysis results obtained from the developed CDTRP in the emulated-plant and also the simulated-plant modes are reliable on the realistic plant models for any kind of controller design methods and further reliable even on poor plant models for the PRC and MRAC design methods.

 

**19.5.2.6**            **Recreating the Parameter Perturbations in the S-E-R Mode** Parameter perturbations were created as a multiplicative effect for the model parameters. The perturbation signals were provided by DC power source in the 0–5 V (DC)

range and were fed to the hardware peripheral unit card via the D_X1 port that was

activated by the ADC options in the GUI, where 1 V for D_X1 corresponds to the nominal plant parameters case. The observed responses of the emulated BP5 controlled by the PRC for four different parameter values are given in Figure 19.8a. The responses observed for the MRAC case are given in Figure 19.8b. In addition, the responses obtained for the PRC and MRAC are compared to each other in terms of their performances for two parameter perturbation values in [Figure 19.9](#_bookmark109). No results are depicted for the PID controller case, since it behaves very poorly in the face of parameter variations. It can be said that the responses under parameter variations are close to each other for the PRC and MRAC. As observed in the above analysis part,

(1) choosing more realistic models yields better emulation results to be obtained by the CDTRP platform and (2) for the MRAC and to a lesser extent for the PRC cases, the responses of the emulator are very close to the physical plant. In light of these facts, it may be concluded that the performances of the controllers on the physical plants under parameter perturbations can be examined using S-E-R mode in the manner that the CDTRP implements.

 

**19.5.2.7**            **Recreating** **Noise** **Disturbance** **in** **the** **S-E-R** **Mode**

Noise disturbances were created as additive to the control signal (i.e., input of the plant model). The noise signal was provided by the signal generator whose range is given in [Table 19.5](#_bookmark108). It was fed to the hardware peripheral unit card via D_U port

​     

\* As seen in Figures 19.7a and b, the responses of the emulated second-order system model are much closer to the real DC motor responses.

that the PID has quite poor performance under the applied additive noise, whereas the PRC and MRAC perform well. It should be noted that the MRAC shows the best steady state performance.

 

**19.5.2.8**            **Response to Single Short-in-Time Large-in-Amplitude** **Pulse Disturbance in the S-E-R and S-R-R Modes**

Recreating the effects of relatively small amplitude noise disturbances in the emulation have been presented above. Now, another kind of disturbance effect, that is, a single short-in-time and large-in-amplitude pulse disturbance effect was created and applied to both the emulated BP5 model and the physical DC motor. This enables a better understanding of the validity of the developed platform in mimicking the behavior of the physical plants under actual disturbances. The disturbance was created as a multiplicative effect to the output of the model. The pulse time and amplitude were chosen in the front panel of the GUI. In the tests, the pulses were created after the transient regime (e.g., at 10 s as shown in [Figure 19.11](#_bookmark111)) to mimic the disturbances appearing in the steady state working conditions for the plant. The measured responses of the physical DC motor and the emulator controlled by the PID, robust, and MRAC controllers are given in Figure 19.11.

All mixed operating modes of CDTRP require at least two of the controller, plant, and peripheral components to be implemented in different units of CDTRP, that is, in two of the simulator (PC), the emulator, and the hardware peripheral unit. So, the mixed modes necessitate real-time compatibility of the PC, emulator, and hardware peripheral unit. In other words, these units have to communicate in a (real-time) synchronized fashion. To examine this ability of the CDTRP, Lorenz systems–based chaotic synchronization is chosen as the benchmark application. As will be seen below, chaotic synchronization is a good example to understand the operating (frequency) limits of the CDTRP.

The following were observed* in a set of experiments conducted:

\1.   The emulator and the simulator cannot be synchronized to each other and to external hardware because of the high frequency dynamics intrinsic to the chaotic (Lorenz) system.

\2.   As a consequence of the maximum achievable sampling frequency that can be realized in the MATLAB environment used for the PC simulator and in the emulator implemented by using the PIC microcontroller, the simulator and the emulator of the developed CDTRP can be synchronized to each other when implementing the dynamics up to 25 Hz while the simulator and the emulator can implement the dynamics up to 300 Hz and 25 Hz, respectively, if they are operated as uncoupled.

\3.   The frequency range of the simulated/emulated system dynamics for which mutual synchronization among the emulator, the simulator, and the external hardware are achievable can be enlarged by using a suitable feedback control.

In the sequel, the experimental results obtained for a set of different kinds of implementations of synchronized coupled Lorenz systems are given first and then the coupled linear undamped pendulums are examined to find the limit for the frequency that enables synchronous operation for the implemented dynamics.

 

**19.5.3.1**            **Analog Hardware Implementation of Synchronized** **Lorenz Chaotic Systems**

Before examining the CDTRP in the E-R-R and R-E-R operating modes for the synchronized system of coupled Lorenz systems, the systems were first implemented as analog hardware (i.e., in the R-R-R mode). The master–slave configuration proposed in Cuomo et al. [56] was used for the implementation. The transmitter and receiver circuits of the Lorenz chaotic systems, whose scaled state equations are given as BP9 and BP10, respectively, in [Table 19.4](#_bookmark105), were realized with the circuit configuration in [Figure 19.12 ](#_bookmark112)using the analog multiplier AD633, opamp LF353, and passive circuit

elements (R1 = R2 = R6 = R7 = 100 kΩ, R3 = R5 = R8 = R10 = 10 kΩ, R4 = R9 =

1 MΩ, RV1 = RV3 = 100 kΩ, RV2 = RV4 = 220 kΩ, and C1 = … = C6 = 100 nF).†

The synchronization result for the analog hardware realization of the master–slave

synchronization of the coupled systems is shown in [Figure 19.13](#_bookmark112).

 

**19.5.3.2**            **Synchronization of (Lorenz Ttransmitter) Emulator** **with a Physical Analog (Lorenz Receiver) Plant**

As a second implementation of master–slave synchronization of coupled Lorenz systems, the CDTRP was operated in the E-R-R mode such that the transmitter BP9

​     

\* It should be noted that the last (interesting) observation can be interpreted as follows: The interfaces among the simulator, emulator, and external hardware have delays due to the interrupt routines, which can be modeled by (complex frequency) poles determining an upper cutoff frequency. And, where the synchronization is achieved, these poles that limit the frequency range can be shifted to a higher frequency point by using feedback control.

† Note that the circuit configuration was chosen as given in Paul [57] but with the BP9-BP10 coefficients as s = 10, *r* = 56.6, and *b* = 5.02. For the coefficients, the Lorenz systems then produce chaotic oscillations with the main harmonics around 8.5 Hz.

was implemented in the emulator of the CDTRP and the receiver implemented as analog hardware shown in Figure 19.12 was used as the plant. The X1 state was observed from the hardware peripheral unit card via the DAC port that was activated by the DAC options in the GUI. The implementation of the system in E-R-R mode is given in [Figure 19.14](#_bookmark113). As seen in [Figure 19.15](#_bookmark113), when operating in the E-R-R mode, the emulator of the CDTRP can roughly mimic the chaotic behavior of the Lorenz system. In this E-R-R mode, the master Lorenz system was realized in the emulator and the slave Lorenz system was realized in the analog hardware. During the experiments, such master–slave coupled Lorenz systems were never observed as synchronized.

mode of operation, the master Lorenz system was implemented in the analog hardware card and the slave Lorenz system was implemented in the emulator. During the experiments conducted for this realization of the master–slave Lorenz system, synchronization was never observed.

 

**19.5.3.4**            **Synchronization of (Lorenz Transmitter) Simulator** **with (Lorenz Receiver) Eemulator**

As a fourth implementation of master–slave synchronization of coupled Lorenz systems, the CDTRP was operated in the S-E-E mode such that the receiver BP10 was implemented in the emulator of the CDTRP and the transmitter was implemented in the simulator of the CDTRP. As seen in Figure 19.18, although both the simulator and emulator can roughly mimic the chaotic behavior of the Lorenz system, they fail to be synchronized to each other in the master–slave configuration.

 

**19.5.3.5**            **Effect of Feedback on Chaotic Synchronization**

The above implemented master–slave configuration for chaotic synchronization is, indeed, an open loop control system where the receiver is the plant and the transmitter output is the reference signal to be tracked by this plant. One can argue that not only the lack of implementing the high frequency components of the chaotic signals is the source of failure to achieve the chaotic synchronization, but also the master–slave configuration is another source of dissynchronization as this open loop control configuration is sensitive to internal/external disturbances and delays. To clarify this point, in a unity feedback closed loop configuration, a PID controller with the parameters *K*p = 1, *K*i = 100, and *K*d = 0.01 is used to provide a suitable control input to the receiver Lorenz system for deriving its output to track the reference chaotic signal produced by the transmitter Lorenz system. As seen in [Figure 19.19](#_bookmark114), the PID controller with unity feedback closed-loop configuration provides the desired synchronization for the Lorenz receiver system whose output

tracks the reference chaotic signal at least for the main harmonics corresponding to low frequency components.

The above-mentioned limits of the CDTRP in implementing the synchronized Lorenz systems are natural consequences of the chaotic dynamics of the Lorenz systems that intrinsically possess high frequency components. Moreover, the implementation is limited by the maximum achievable sampling frequencies that can be realized in the MATLAB environment used for the PC simulator and in the emulator implemented by the PIC microcontroller. As seen in the last closed-loop implementation of coupled Lorenz systems based on a simple PID controller, the synchronization can be achieved by using a suitable feedback at least for the main (low frequency) harmonics of the chaotic signals. The exact frequency range for the control system dynamics that allows synchronous operations of the units of the CDTRP platform in implementing these dynamics was investigated by considering what may be the simplest yet challenging example, namely the linear undamped pendulums. The corresponding results are presented in the next section.

 

**19.5.3.6**            **Synchronization of (Linear Undamped Pendulum** **Receiver) Simulator/Emulator with (Signal Generator** **Transmitter) Simulator**

To determine the reliable operating frequency range for the simulator and emulator when communicating with each other, first, a signal generator was used as a transmitter in a master–slave configuration for deriving the emulator or simulator where the BP8 pendulum model was implemented (Figure 19.20a). Then, a PID controller with parameters *K*p = 1, *K*i = 100, and *K*d = 0.001 in the unity feedback closed-loop configuration was used to control the receiver pendulum to track the output of the signal generator. For both the configurations, the CDTRP was operated in the S-E-E mode and also in the S-S-S mode (Figure 19.20b.). It was observed that both the

implemented modes yield almost identical results up to *f* =25 Hz, as shown by the results obtained for the S-S-S mode given in [Figure 19.21](#_bookmark115).

On the one hand, in the open-loop configuration, the synchronization that was achieved for *f* = 1 Hz was observed to fail beyond *f* = 10 Hz. On the other hand, in the closed-loop configuration, it was observed that the synchronizations sustained up to *f* = 100 Hz and *f* = 25 Hz in the S-S-S mode and the S-E-E mode, respectively. These observations actually determine the limit of the operating frequency for the

control systems dynamics whose real-time implementations in the S-E-E and S-S-S modes of the CDTRP are reliable in the sense that they can be considered as valid real-time implementations.

 

**19.5.3.7**            **Synchronization of (Linear Undamped Pendulum) Receiver** **Emulator with (Signal Generator) Transmitter**

To determine the reliable frequency range for the emulator in the R-E-E and R-E-R modes of CDTRP where it receives a signal from external analog hardware, the receiver BP8 was implemented in the emulator and analog signal generator test equipment was used for the transmitter as shown in [Figure 19.22](#_bookmark116). The *x*t analog signal was applied to the emulator via the hardware peripheral unit card by the U port that was activated by the ADC options in the GUI. The difference between the experiments done in the S-E-E mode shown in Figure 19.20 and in the R-E-E and R-E-R modes shown in Figure 19.22 is in the transmitter part such that in the former one the transmitter is realized in the simulator and in the other ones the transmitter is realized in analog hardware. The analog signal received by the emulator and also the output of the pendulum created in the emulator are transferred from the emulator to the GUI. Therefore, the unique additional source of limiting the frequency range of the emulated dynamics in this experiment is the usage of the input U port of the emulator operated by the ADC. As shown in [Figure 19.23](#_bookmark116), it was observed that in the open-loop

configuration of [Figure 19.22](#_bookmark116), the synchronization was achieved up to *f* = 1.52 Hz. It should be noted that the relatively narrower frequency range than the one obtained for

*K*i = 100, and *K*d = 0.001 in the unity feedback closed-loop configuration for controlling the receiver pendulum to track the output of the analog signal generator. The PID controller was implemented as analog hardware (Leybold LH 734 06 PID- Controller Lab Equipment), so the CDTRP was operated in the (closed-loop) R-E-E

and R-E-R modes. Note that the frequency limit is lower than *f* = 25 Hz, which is the one observed for the closed-loop (signal generator–pendulum) synchronization

in the S-E-E mode since the analog output of the DAC interface of the plant emulator card was also used in addition to the analog input of the ADC interface of the emulator.* The above results show that the real-time implementations of the control

systems dynamics realized in the R-E-E and R-E-R modes are reliable up to the *f* =

2.92 Hz frequency.

 

**19.5.3.8**            **Synchronization** **of** **a** **Physical** **Analog** **(Lorenz** **Receiver)** **Hardware with Transmitter Emulator**

As the last implementation, the emulator implementing transmitter was used for deriving an analog receiver, that is, the Lorenz system. Then, the reliable frequency range for the emulator in the E-R-E and E-R-R modes of CDTRP was examined. The pure sinusoidal signal generated in the emulator was applied via the DAC interface of the emulator in an additive manner to the first state of the Lorenz system implemented in the hardware peripheral unit card (see [Figure 19.25](#_bookmark117)). Note that the Lorenz system was realized by the capacitances for reducing the main harmonics of the chaotic signal around the maximum reliable real-time operation frequency of the emulator. The source of limiting the frequency range of the implemented dynamics in this experiment is the usage of analog output of the DAC interface of the plant emulator card. As shown in [Figures 19.26 ](#_bookmark117)and 19.28, it was observed that

the synchronization is achieved up to *f* = 4.05 Hz in the open-loop configuration of [Figure 19.28 ](#_bookmark118)and achieved up to *f* = 9.09 Hz for the closed-loop configuration with a PID controller with the parameters *K*p = 1, *K*i = 100, and *K*d = 0.001 in the unity

feedback in [Figure 19.27 ](#_bookmark118)(where Leybold LH 734 06 PID-Controller Lab Equipment was used again).

It should be noted that the Lorenz system derived by the pure sinusoidal transmitter signal did not exhibit a chaotic Lorenz signal for the large amplitude values of transmitter signal anymore and that the synchronization was indeed achieved for the main harmonic of the disturbed Lorenz signal. So the phase synchronizations seen in Figures 19.26 and 19.27 were not exact because of the subharmonics. The subharmonics appear as a consequence of the considered operating mode, which requires the implementation of a part of the Lorenz system in the analog hardware and the other part in the emulator so that their interface is a source of nonlinearity causing subharmonics. The results show that the real-time implementations of the control

systems dynamics realized in the E-R-E and E-R-R modes are reliable up to the *f* =

9.09 Hz frequency.

\* Observe from Figure 19.22 that the analog output of the emulator was fed to the oscilloscope and also to the analog PID hardware.
