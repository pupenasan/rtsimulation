**20.1**           **INTRODUCTION**

The automotive industry is continuously demanding shorter development cycles in order to maintain competitiveness. For this reason, car manufacturers have always been adopting state-of-the-art strategies to shorten the time to market such as simul- taneous engineering, rapid product development, and front loading of the develop- ment process. These are examples where simulation techniques are key enablers. The use of simulation in the development process leads to an early increase of knowledge. Consequently, subsequent processes can start sooner, which amounts to time and cost savings. Nowadays, simulation is used throughout all phases of prod- uct development, in the conceptual design and requirements phase, during design of hardware and software, and in computer-aided production planning. However, it still is most efficient in early stages of the development process. Particularly, the model- ing and simulation of dynamic systems accelerates development in early phases, for example, in feasibility studies by evaluating the potential of new topologies using virtual prototypes or in the automated and model-based design of control strategies.

Simulation allows technical prototypes to mature quicker and at the same time reduce their number. Moreover, fewer experiments on test stands are necessary.

The behavior of technical systems can be described and investigated by dynamic system modeling and simulation. Real-time (RT) techniques serve as a natural sup- plement to modeling and simulation and allow for the running simulation to “con- nect” with real-world systems in various ways. Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) methods are an explicit incarnation of this coupling of virtual and technical systems in that one or more virtual components of the simulation model are replaced with physical ones. The physical parts of the technical system interact with the numerical model that simulates the realistic physical behavior of the remaining virtual components as sketched in Figure 20.1.

The HIL system has two main requirements that must be met: Firstly, the inter- face has to provide real physical entities such as force, torque, current, etc. This is done by actuators, sensors, and their controls. If the system to be interfaced is a computer such as an embedded system, coupling is somewhat simpler because it takes place at an electrical signal level. This method is beneficial especially for the development and testing of electronic control units of computer-based systems, for example, engine control units (ECUs) in Schuette and Ploeger (2007). Secondly, physical behavior of the simulation model must execute synchronously with the physical system parts, or in *real time*. A closer look reveals that it is sufficient to have the relevant physical information, or *states*, from the simulation available only at every point in time when virtual and physical parts, which may also be human operators, must interact through the interface.

This chapter presents some aspects of how automotive development benefits from RT and HIL methods. Section 20.2 provides an overview of challenges and restric- tions of modeling automotive systems in a RT context. Simulating multidomain systems such as passenger cars requires special care when choosing modeling approaches, approximations, and mathematical formalisms. Section 20.3 focuses on the RT simulation and control of a combustion engine—itself a classic multidomain system—as a prime example. Section 20.4 highlights several applications of the RT methods and models but also addresses the limitations of these approaches. Finally, Section 20.5 presents some concluding thoughts.
