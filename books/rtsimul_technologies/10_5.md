## 10.5. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this chapter we presented an innovative mechanism for RTOS emulation inside ISS. In addition to being nonintrusive in the ISS source code, the described techniques are extended for the emulation of real-time tasks. High code equivalence is maintained, enabling fast and accurate simulation of real-time applications. This powerful RTOS emulation mechanism allows the early DSE of the RTOS and its configuration. In particular, it helps the designer determine the best OS parameters (such as scheduling mechanism, tick frequency, etc.) and allows the early evaluation of important performace metrics (e.g., missed deadline count and interrupt response time). Our methodology has been applied to many mixed-workload (real-time and non-real-time) applications and benchmarks, showing how it can be used to analyze their real-time behavior and how the system can be parametrized to obtain the desired performance for both the real-time and non-real-time parts.
