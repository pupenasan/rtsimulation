**24.5**   **EXAMPLE:** **PRESSURE-CONTROLLED** **SERVO** **VALVE**

**24.5.1**             **m****odel** **d****efinition**

This section demonstrates the derivation and implementation in the MathWorks Simulink® [16] product of a hybrid-system model for the hydraulic circuit shown in Figure 24.2. The circuit consists of a two-stage servo valve controlling the pressure in a 6 m long hydraulic pipe that is terminated at one end. The first stage in the servo valve consists of a flapper mechanism driven by a torque motor. The second stage spool is acted upon by a pilot pressure from the first stage as well as a spring force to center the spool when not under load. In addition, there is a small internal volume of fluid within the valve that acts on the spool and provides a feedback mechanism to control the pressure at the output port. A more detailed description of the operation and use of the servo valve is provided in Ref. [17].

The signal flow diagram in [Figure 24.3 ](#_bookmark150)shows the fluid flow into the four internal junctions (circles) due to either flow through connecting orifices (solid lines) or the motion of the spool itself (dashed lines). The aim is to simulate the dynamics of the servo valve when the fluid within these small connecting volumes is assumed to be incompressible.

[Table 24.1 ](#_bookmark149)provides a description of each of the parameters within the model, along with representative numerical values. The level of detail within this model is typical of an initial system-level definition before more detailed performance models are developed.

Some parts of the model are represented by systems of ODEs that are simulated using standard solvers. The response of the flapper (*x*d) in Figure 24.4 to a change in input current (*i*y) to the torque motor is assumed to be first order with a time

constant equal to τm. The transfer function is given in Equation 24.46, where *g*f

provides the steady-state gain between the current input and the achieved flapper

displacement.

Although the fluid within the servo is treated as incompressible, the fluid within the connected pipe is treated as compressible as the volume of fluid is significantly greater than that within the servo valve. The compressibility also provides an important memory of the fluid pressure when the valve is centered, and the pipe is effectively isolated from the rest of the system. For this example, the fluid pressure

*P* within the pipe is determined from Equation 24.49, where βe is the effective bulk modulus, *V*p is the volume of fluid within the pipe, and the flow rate *Q*t is deter-

mined in Equation 24.50. Treating the fluid in this case as a single lumped volume

The discrete modes of operation must be established before the model dynamics can be derived. The modes can be defined by the relationship between the orifice areas and the position of the flapper or spool. The fluid flows through the second stage of the valve at speeds *v*l1 and *v*l2, and the respective orifice areas *A*l1 and *A*l2 are functions of the spool position shown in Figure 24.5. The figure shows that there are five discrete modes depending on whether the spool has reached its end

stops (in which case *v*s = 0), or whether the orifices are fully closed in which case either *v*l1 = 0 or *v*l2 = 0. The flapper mechanism provides three additional modes depending on whether the flapper blocks one of the nozzle areas. In total, there

are 15 discrete modes, and each has its own defined set of minimal order dynamic equations.

Control over switching between sets of dynamic equations is governed by the finite state machine implemented using the MathWorks Stateflow® product [18] and shown in [Figure 24.6](#_bookmark151). The flapper and the spool are controlled through two indepen- dent parallel states. The transition between modes is governed by events triggered by a zero-crossing signal in the model. Events can occur because of either an orifice opening or closing or contact between a physical object and its end-stop. In the case of contact occurring, the subsequent release of the object is triggered by a change in sign of the calculated reaction force.

The very nature of the finite state machine representation means that it is ideal for including additional features that are of interest to the control engineer. In particular, the effect on the system behavior of introducing faults into the system is easily inves- tigated by introducing trigger signals that force the model to transition into a failure state. An example where this would be appropriate is the case where a valve becomes stuck open or closed and cannot move until the failure is cleared.

Equation 24.51. Two mass cases are considered for comparison. The first assumes that that there is a small mass of fluid in each line and in the second case all the mass elements are assumed to be negligible and are set to zero. If there is a zero mass matrix, then the dynamics of the flow through the servo valve reduces to a system of algebraic equations that must be solved at each time step for the reduced order state vector.

The flow constraints at the junctions are defined by the matrix **WJ** given in Equation 24.52. These constraints are maintained for all modes of operation and can be considered to be configuration constraints. The additional constraint (**WC**) introduced because of the closed orifice *A*l2 is given in Equation 24.53.

In this mode, there are eight velocity states and five linear constraints. This leads to a minimum order system consisting of three independent states. The selec- tion of the independent states from the full state vector is made by direct inspec- tion of the symbolically derived basis vectors for the null space of the constraint matrix. The derived symbolic matrix is shown in Equation 24.54, with the rows and columns rearranged so that the order of the states is consistent with that in Equation 24.11.

The simulated responses to a series of step changes in demanded output pressure are shown in [Figures 24.7 ](#_bookmark152)and 24.8. Each figure shows the simulation results from the following four model implementations:

 

\1.   An incompressible fluid model with a full mass matrix

\2.   An incompressible fluid model with all masses within the servo made equal to zero

\3.   A purely compressible fluid model, simulated using a “stiff” solver

\4.   An incompressible fluid model with a zero mass matrix running in discrete time (updated at 1000 Hz)

 

Figure 24.7 shows for each of the above models the pressure at the internal junc- tion within the servo valve and the controlled pressure at the output port. [Figure 24.8](#_bookmark152) shows the spool position and the resulting flow into the pipe. The dynamic response of each model implementation is very close, demonstrating that little accuracy has been lost by making the assumption that small volumes of fluid within the servo valve act instantaneously.

The transition between systems of reduced order dynamic equations is demon- strated in [Figure 24.9](#_bookmark154), which shows the spool position and the identification number for the model that is being executed. The plot demonstrates that all five modes relat- ing to the second-stage spool have been entered during the simulation.

A comparison of the average time taken to run each of the Simulink models is shown in [Table 24.2](#_bookmark153). The models were simulated using MathWorks MATLAB® version R2006b, running on a PC with an Intel® Dual Core2 CPU running at

2.13 GHz. Model (1) clearly takes the longest time to simulate, demonstrating the detrimental effect of introducing small masses of fluid to act as connect- ing elements. By comparison, the simulation time of Model (3) is significantly

faster, demonstrating that current “stiff” solvers are very efficient. Simulating this model using the default variable step solver (ODE45) proved to be prohibi- tively slow by comparison. The simulation time of Model (2) is less than half that of Model (3), which demonstrates the proposed aim of this work, namely that being able to take larger time steps during the simulation because of the removal of the high-frequency modes outweighs the additional computational overhead to implement a DAE solver. The greatest improvement in runtime is achieved with Model (4) where all the continuous time integrators were replaced with discrete time states, and the very fast dynamics of the torque motor were replaced by a constant gain.
