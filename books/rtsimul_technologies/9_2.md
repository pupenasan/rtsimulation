## 9.2. REAL-TIME SIMULATOR TECHNOLOGY

Simulator technology has evolved from physical/analog simulators (e.g., HVDC simulators and transient network analyzer (TNA)) for EMT and protection and con- trol studies, to hybrid TNA/analog/digital simulators with the capability of studying electromechanical transient behavior [22], to fully digital real-time simulators, as illustrated in Figure 9.5.

technologies, physical simulators have been gradually replaced with fully digital real- time simulators.

DSP-based real-time simulators developed using proprietary technology, and used primarily for HIL studies, were the first of the new breed of digital simulator to become commercially available [23]. However, the limitations of using propri- etary hardware were quickly recognized, leading to the development of commercial supercomputer-based simulators, such as HYPERSIM™ from Hydro-Quebec [24] or RTDS™ real-time simulator [25]. Attempts have been made by a number of universi- ties and research organizations to develop fully digital real-time simulators using low-cost standard PC technology in an effort to eliminate the high costs associated with the use of high-end supercomputers [16]. Such development was very diffi- cult due to the lack of fast, low-cost intercomputer communication links. However, the advent of low-cost, easily obtainable multicore processors [26] (from INTEL and AMD) and related commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) computer components has directly addressed this issue, clearing the way for the development of much lower cost and easily scalable real-time simulators. The availability of this low-cost, high- performance processor technology has also reduced the need to cluster multiple PCs to conduct complex parallel simulation. This reduces dependence on sometimes costly fast intercomputer communication technology.

COTS-based high-end real-time simulators equipped with multicore processors have been used in aerospace, robotics, automotive, and power electronic system design and testing for a number of years [27,28]. Recent advancements in multicore processor tech- nology means that such simulators are now available for the simulation of EMT expected in large-scale power grids, microgrids, wind farms, and power systems installed in large electrical ships and aircraft. These simulators, operating under Windows, LINUX, and standard real-time operating systems, have the potential to be compatible with multi- domain tools, including simulation tools. This capability enables the analysis of interac- tions between electrical, power electronic, mechanical, and fluid dynamic systems.

The latest trend in real-time simulation consists of exporting simulation models to field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) [29]. This approach has many advantages. First, com- putation time within each time step is almost independent of the system size because of the parallel nature of FPGAs. Second, overruns cannot occur once the model is running and timing constraints are met. Last, but most importantly, the simulation step size can be very small, in the order of 250 ns. There are still limitations on model size since the num- ber of gates is limited in FPGAs; nevertheless, this technique is promising for the future.
