## 15.1. INTRODUCTION

Parallel and distributed simulation (PADS) emerged in the early 1980s, and over the past three decades, PADS systems have matured into vital technologies, par- ticularly for military applications. This chapter provides a basic overview of one specific PADS application area: *distributed real-time simulation-based training* (SBT)*.* The chapter opens with a brief description of distributed real-time SBT and

its development. It then lists the recurrent challenges faced by such systems with respect to instructional best practices, technology, and use.

We begin by clarifying the phrase “distributed real-time SBT.” Consider each key word, in turn. First, *distributed* simulations are networks of geographically dis- persed simulators (often called “federates”) that execute a single overall model, or more colloquially, that share a single “place.” Next, *real-time* simulations are those that advance at the same rate as actual time [1]. Finally, *training* simulations are instructional tools that employ training strategies (such as scenario-based training) and represent a problem-solving context to facilitate guided practice [2,3]. Thus, for this chapter, consider the following definition (see Figure 15.1 for an illustration):

 

Distributed real-time SBT involves two or more geographically distributed computer- based simulations that are interconnected through a network and track the passing of real time; they are used concurrently by multiple trainees, whose individual inputs affect the overall shared environment, and they include instructionally supported, suf- ficiently realistic problem-solving environments in which trainees can learn or practice their knowledge, skills, and attitudes.

 

Distributed real-time SBT is considered a primary enabling technology for the

U.S. military. It supports Joint (i.e., across military branches) and interagency train- ing and mission rehearsal, development and testing of new tactics and techniques, and assessment of personnel skills [4]. In turn, these capabilities reduce risks, save lives and money, and engender increased operational capabilities. Section 15.2 offers
