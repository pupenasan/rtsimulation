## 13.7.CONCLUSIONS

This chapter presents an FCS development using an innovative, interactive simula- tion platform. It integrates design, testing, and flight simulation to provide a close- to-reality engineering development practice. Valuable lessons are learned through “flight testing” experience. It also provides feedback for design fine-tuning and improvement.
