**24.6**   **CONCLUSIONS**

This chapter has demonstrated a systematic approach to deriving hybrid system models of a hydraulic circuit using a combination of symbolic and numeric techniques. The models are defined in terms of the original circuit layout, but the dynamics of small volumes of fluid are abstracted to instantaneous changes in state. The efficiency of the resulting models, using standard off-the-shelf solvers, has been tested by comparing simulation times with models that use small volumes of compressible fluid as connecting elements and current state-of-the-art “stiff” solvers. The simulation times of the hybrid system models have been shown to be lower than the reference models using a “stiff” solver. The greatest improvement in simulation time is achieved when the hybrid system models are run in discrete time, which is not an option when relying on the “stiff” solvers. The ability to run models in discrete time faster than real time demon- strates the potential to run simulations of hydraulic circuits in true real time, while still maintaining a faithful representation of the inherent nonlinear behavior of the circuit
